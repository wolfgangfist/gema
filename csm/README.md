# CSM Speech Generator

A web app for generating realistic speech using the Conversational Speech Model (CSM) from Sesame.

## Features

- Text-to-Speech Generation**: Convert text to realistic speech
- **Voice Customization**: Upload or record audio to customize the voice identities
- **Interactive Web Interface**: Simple Gradio UI for easy interaction
- **Conversation Context**: Maintains history for natural-sounding exchanges

## Deployment to Hugging Face Spaces

This repository is designed to be easily deployed to Hugging Face Spaces.

### How to deploy

1. Fork this repository to your own GitHub account
2. Create a new Hugging Face Space:
   - Go to [Hugging Face Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces)
   - Click "Create new Space"
   - Give it a name like "csm-speech-generator"
   - Select "Gradio" as the SDK
   - Choose a license (Apache 2.0 recommended to match the CSM license)
   - Click "Create Space"

3. Connect to GitHub:
   - In your new Space, go to the "Files" tab
   - Click "Link repository"
   - Select your forked repository
   - Choose the main branch
   - Click "Link"

4. The Space will automatically use `app.py` as the entry point and install all dependencies from `requirements.txt`

5. After a few minutes, your model should be deployed and accessible through the Hugging Face UI

### Hardware Requirements

For the best experience, select a GPU-enabled space. The model can run on CPU, but generation will be much slower.

## Local Development

To run the app locally:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/csm-speech-generator.git
cd csm-speech-generator

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the app
python app.py
```

The app will be available at http://localhost:7860

## Customizing Voices

You can upload or record your own voice samples through the UI to customize the voice identities used for generation.

For best results:
- Record at least 5-10 seconds of clear speech
- Make sure the text matches what you say exactly
- Use a consistent speaking style and tone
- Record in a quiet environment

## Model Information

This app uses the CSM-1B model from Sesame, which is:
- Licensed under Apache 2.0
- Designed for conversational speech generation
- Based on a Llama backbone with a specialized audio decoder

For more information about the model, visit [Sesame's CSM repository](https://github.com/SesameAILabs/csm).

## License

This implementation is released under the same license as the CSM project from Sesame (Apache 2.0).

CSM (Conversational Speech Model) is a speech generation model from [Sesame](https://www.sesame.com) that generates RVQ audio codes from text and audio inputs. The model architecture employs a [Llama](https://www.llama.com/) backbone and a smaller audio decoder that produces [Mimi](https://huggingface.co/kyutai/mimi) audio codes.

A fine-tuned variant of CSM powers the [interactive voice demo](https://www.sesame.com/voicedemo) shown in our [blog post](https://www.sesame.com/research/crossing_the_uncanny_valley_of_voice).

A hosted [Hugging Face space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/sesame/csm-1b) is also available for testing audio generation.

## Requirements

* A CUDA-compatible GPU
* The code has been tested on CUDA 12.4 and 12.6, but it may also work on other versions
* Similarly, Python 3.10 is recommended, but newer versions may be fine
* For some audio operations, `ffmpeg` may be required
* Access to the following Hugging Face models:
  * [Llama-3.2-1B](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B)
  * [CSM-1B](https://huggingface.co/sesame/csm-1b)

### Setup

```bash
git clone git@github.com:SesameAILabs/csm.git
cd csm
python3.10 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Disable lazy compilation in Mimi
export NO_TORCH_COMPILE=1

# You will need access to CSM-1B and Llama-3.2-1B
huggingface-cli login
```

### Windows Setup

The `triton` package cannot be installed in Windows. Instead use `pip install triton-windows`.

## Quickstart

This script will generate a conversation between 2 characters, using a prompt for each character.

```bash
python run_csm.py
```

## Usage

If you want to write your own applications with CSM, the following examples show basic usage.

#### Generate a sentence

This will use a random speaker identity, as no prompt or context is provided.

```python
from generator import load_csm_1b
import torchaudio
import torch

if torch.backends.mps.is_available():
    device = "mps"
elif torch.cuda.is_available():
    device = "cuda"
else:
    device = "cpu"

generator = load_csm_1b(device=device)

audio = generator.generate(
    text="Hello from Sesame.",
    speaker=0,
    context=[],
    max_audio_length_ms=10_000,
)

torchaudio.save("audio.wav", audio.unsqueeze(0).cpu(), generator.sample_rate)
```

#### Generate with context

CSM sounds best when provided with context. You can prompt or provide context to the model using a `Segment` for each speaker's utterance.

NOTE: The following example is instructional and the audio files do not exist. It is intended as an example for using context with CSM.

```python
from generator import Segment

speakers = [0, 1, 0, 0]
transcripts = [
    "Hey how are you doing.",
    "Pretty good, pretty good.",
    "I'm great.",
    "So happy to be speaking to you.",
]
audio_paths = [
    "utterance_0.wav",
    "utterance_1.wav",
    "utterance_2.wav",
    "utterance_3.wav",
]

def load_audio(audio_path):
    audio_tensor, sample_rate = torchaudio.load(audio_path)
    audio_tensor = torchaudio.functional.resample(
        audio_tensor.squeeze(0), orig_freq=sample_rate, new_freq=generator.sample_rate
    )
    return audio_tensor

segments = [
    Segment(text=transcript, speaker=speaker, audio=load_audio(audio_path))
    for transcript, speaker, audio_path in zip(transcripts, speakers, audio_paths)
]
audio = generator.generate(
    text="Me too, this is some cool stuff huh?",
    speaker=1,
    context=segments,
    max_audio_length_ms=10_000,
)

torchaudio.save("audio.wav", audio.unsqueeze(0).cpu(), generator.sample_rate)
```

## FAQ

**Does this model come with any voices?**

The model open-sourced here is a base generation model. It is capable of producing a variety of voices, but it has not been fine-tuned on any specific voice.

**Can I converse with the model?**

CSM is trained to be an audio generation model and not a general-purpose multimodal LLM. It cannot generate text. We suggest using a separate LLM for text generation.

**Does it support other languages?**

The model has some capacity for non-English languages due to data contamination in the training data, but it likely won't do well.

## Misuse and abuse ⚠️

This project provides a high-quality speech generation model for research and educational purposes. While we encourage responsible and ethical use, we **explicitly prohibit** the following:

- **Impersonation or Fraud**: Do not use this model to generate speech that mimics real individuals without their explicit consent.
- **Misinformation or Deception**: Do not use this model to create deceptive or misleading content, such as fake news or fraudulent calls.
- **Illegal or Harmful Activities**: Do not use this model for any illegal, harmful, or malicious purposes.

By using this model, you agree to comply with all applicable laws and ethical guidelines. We are **not responsible** for any misuse, and we strongly condemn unethical applications of this technology.
